# Project: Maze Solving using Nature-Inspired Computing

## About the Project
Our project focuses on solving the maze pathfinding problem using nature-inspired computing techniques. We explore two prominent algorithms: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). The goal is to compare their effectiveness in finding the optimal path in a randomly generated maze. The maze is generated using algorithms such as Prim's algorithm or Recursive Backtracking, and the results of the algorithms are visualized for clear comparison. This project demonstrates the application of bio-inspired methods to complex optimization problems, providing insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
